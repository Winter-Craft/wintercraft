**BEFORE YOU SUBMIT**
We want you to provide as much information as possible, but if what's stopping you from providing feedback is writing an essay on what went wrong, **don't worry about it.** Just write a quick summary of what went wrong and we'll get in touch for details. If this all seems like too much of a bother, just ping one of the staff on Discord and we'll investigate, although going with that approach rather than a proper report here will make it less likely to be followed up on!

This page is ment for submitting reports on **technical** issues, not feedback on features or unwanted behaviour (unless by "unwanted" you mean "unexpected", i.e. the feature is not working as it was intended by the developer). For that, please refer to the Feature request template.

Also note that we simply host this server, we do not maintain any of the plugins on it! While we will do what we can to solve the issue and where possible repair damage that has been done by the issue, most of us are not Java developers. We do not garuantee to solve all issues no matter what, rather to do our best within reason.

This page supports posting using styling with (Github's Markdown)[https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/], to help format your text and make it more readable. We recommend using it as far as you can be bothered, but it's obviously not a requirement to submit a report.


**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
Example: "Jumping into water crashes my client"

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Find water (I tried this at coordinates (1234,6543) and (5234,5131), both did this)
2.Jump into the water
3. ???
4. Crash :(

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
Ex.: "I expected to jump into the water and not crash. Swimming is important to me, please fix."

**Screenshots or logs**
If applicable, add screenshots or a link to a crashdump/log to help explain your problem. **PLEASE DON'T POST FULL CRASH LOGS/DUMPS!** Instead, go to https://justpaste.it/ or https://pastebin.com/ and submit it there, and then put the link the site gives you here. Note that everything submitted to pastebin is seachable, so avoid having personally identifiable data posted there, because deleting stuff is a pain unless you post it while logged into your account.

Ex. <picture/vid of the erranous behaviour (i.e. you jumping into water and crashing)>
Ex2. <pastebin link to a crash log or error message>
Note: If it's just a single or two-line error message, having it hosted on a separate web service like pastebin.org is not really neccesary, although certainly doesn't hurt.

**Environment:**
 - OS: [ex. iOS, Windows 7/8/10, Ubuntu 18.02 LTE]
 - Java version: [ex. Java 7 u80, Java 8 u192]
 - World location: [ ex. x: 2312, y: 1412, z: 3423, nether ]

**Additional context:**
Add any other context about the problem here. 
Keep in mind that there is no such thing as too little information in a bug report! However, you should remove any personally identifiable information from your submitted data (pics, logs, etc) unless neccesary to solve the issue. These reports are **PUBLIC**, so anythng you don't want everyone to see you keep to yourself.
